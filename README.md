# Genrl
## Introduction
We introduce Generative Reinforcement Learning (Genrl), a **model-free** and **value-function-free** reinforcement learning method, where **ONLY** neural networks are involved.
We 

## Features
- **Neural Nets are all you need**: No need for the Bellman function, and none of the complicated jargon found in current deep reinforcement learning methods.
- **Highly custimizable**: All you need to do is to customize state, action and reward-shaping or vectorizing.

## Status
The project is currently in active development. We are continually adding new features and improving the performance.

## Getting Started
To get started with Genrl, follow these steps:

1. **Open the .ipynb in colab**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/awesome-project.git```
2. **Ctrl + F10**
3. **Take a rest and wait for the result**
